# Lady Manners School Hack Club website

This is the website of my school's Hack Club, which I am submitting to one of Hack Club's You Ship We Ship programs: Raspite.

I decided to start a Hack Club at my school because I have been involved in a few of their programs, and I really enjoy the community and the support I received from the people running Hack Club. It matters a lot to me that other students my age can have similar experiences to me and can lean about tech through Hack Club.
